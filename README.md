# OG Docs 📝

**A modern, real-time collaborative documentation platform built for speed, security, and developer-centric content control.**

## About The Project

**OG Docs** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the way teams and developers write, edit, and share documentation together. The platform emphasizes structured content delivery and real-time collaboration, moving beyond traditional plain-text storage toward a robust, custom-tailored data architecture.

Built as a high-performance **MERN** application, OG Docs enables multiple collaborators to work simultaneously in a shared workspace, with changes reflected instantly for everyone—ensuring smooth, efficient, and transparent collaboration.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Real-Time Collaborative Workspace:** A dedicated editing area where multiple collaborators can make changes simultaneously, with updates reflected in real time.
* **Custom Slate.js Engine:** A custom-built implementation that structures content into JSON format for consistent styling and long-term portability.
* **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, responsive interface built with **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS 4.0**, and **CoreUI** components.
* **Secure Authentication:** Integrated **Google OAuth** for fast and secure user access.
* **Developer-Friendly Build:** Optimized with **Vite** for near-instant hot module replacement (HMR).
* **Robust Security:** Hardened backend using **Helmet**, **HPP**, **Rate Limiting**, and **Zod** for strict schema validation.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The core logic of OG Docs revolves around a structured, collaborative data pipeline:

1. **The Input:** Contributors write using a custom editor powered by **Slate.js**. Instead of generating raw HTML, the editor produces a clean **JSON tree** representing the document structure.
2. **The Collaboration Layer:** Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously, with real-time updates synchronized across all active sessions.
3. **The Storage:** The JSON structure is validated using **Zod** and securely stored in **MongoDB** via **Mongoose** models.
4. **The Rendering:** On the frontend, a custom rendering engine traverses the JSON tree and dynamically paints the content using Tailwind-styled React components.
